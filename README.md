# guava-light
A trimmed down verison of Google Guava Android lib (https://github.com/google/guava) with the goal of reducing DEX count in a final APK.  Based off of https://github.com/RomainPiel/guava-light.

The current Google Guava library is massive sitting at over 2MB.  This project is currently serving a trimmed down version to support our Fyber UE4 plugin (https://github.com/getsetgames/Fyber) but could be used elsewhere as well.
